        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weralgreenfield-com-gm/.co.gm/main/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-12-at-1.55.35-PM-768x1152.jpeg" alt="Weral Greenfield Farm">
        <p>Welcome to Weral Greenfield, a pioneering youth led agricultural startup committed to reshaping farming in The Gambia. Founded in 2025 by Fatoumata Touray, a 20 year old visionary from the farming community of Banyaaka, Weral Greenfield is more than a farm, it is a mission to create lasting solutions for water scarcity, low productivity, and food insecurity.</p>
        <p>Our core innovation is a solar powered automated drip irrigation system, designed to reduce water waste, cut energy costs, and make farming more productive and resilient in a changing climate. By combining renewable energy, smart farming practices, and community driven values, we are building a pathway to food security, youth empowerment, and sustainable growth in The Gambia and beyond.</p>
        <p>From our humble pilot farm, we have already produced cucumbers, green peppers, and tomatoes that generated income for the business while proving that green technology can thrive in local agriculture. As we expand, our goal is simple: to transform farmlands into green fields of prosperity for smallholder farmers, families, and communities.</p>
        <p>Whether you are a farmer seeking affordable irrigation, an investor looking for high-impact opportunities, or a partner who believes in climate-smart solutions, you are welcome to join us in this journey. Together, let’s grow a future where every drop of water counts, every harvest sustains, and every innovation uplifts communities.</p>

    <section id="our-story">
        <h2>Our Story / About Us</h2>
        <p>Weral Greenfield was born from a deep connection to the land. Growing up in Latrikunda Sabiji, Fatoumata Touray witnessed the struggles of smallholder farmers: crops withering under erratic rainfall, high fuel costs draining household incomes, and the constant fear of food shortages. She saw women and youth working tirelessly, only to yield little because of outdated irrigation systems that wasted up to 70% of water.</p>
        <p>Determined to change this narrative, Fatoumata invested her savings of D570,000 to establish Weral Greenfield’s pilot farm in early 2025. With bold courage, she introduced solar powered automated drip irrigation, a system that brings water directly to the roots of plants, ensuring crops thrive even in the driest seasons. The results were encouraging: cucumbers, peppers, and tomatoes flourished, generating sales of D33,300 in the very first harvest and proving the model’s viability.</p>
        <p>Our name, Weral Greenfield, symbolizes renewal and growth. We are driven by values of sustainability, inclusivity, and innovation, prioritizing youth and women in employment while blending traditional farming knowledge with modern technology. Today, Weral Greenfield operates as a fast-growing agritech venture, but at its heart, it remains a story of resilience, hope, and the belief that farming can be both profitable and sustainable.</p>

            <li>2025: First Harvest</li>
            <li>Future: Expansion</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="challenge">
        <h2>The Challenge / Problem We Solve</h2>
        <p>Agriculture is the backbone of The Gambia’s economy, employing over 70% of the population and contributing about a quarter of the national GDP. Yet, farmers especially smallholders face challenges that limit progress:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Erratic rainfall worsened by climate change, leading to crop failures.</li>
            <li>Inefficient irrigation, with traditional methods wasting huge amounts of water.</li>
            <li>High fuel costs, as many rely on fuel-powered pumps for water supply.</li>
            <li>Soil degradation, caused by overwatering and poor water management.</li>
            <li>Food insecurity, with over 13% of Gambians lacking consistent access to nutritious meals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This combination traps farming families in cycles of low yields and poverty. Without intervention, the impacts of climate change will only intensify, further threatening livelihoods and national food security.</p>

    <section id="solution">
        <h2>Our Solution / Technology</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weralgreenfield-com-gm/.co.gm/main/Screenshot_20250407-174112.jpg" alt="Solar-Powered Drip Irrigation System">
        <p>Weral Greenfield offers a solar powered automated drip irrigation system tailored to Gambian farmers’ needs. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Direct water delivery: Water goes straight to the plant roots, reducing waste by up to 70%.</li>
            <li>Solar powered pumps: Eliminates reliance on expensive fuel or unreliable grid electricity.</li>
            <li>Automated sensors: Measure soil moisture and adjust water flow in real time, ensuring crops get just what they need.</li>
            <li>Scalable design: Suitable for small family farms or larger commercial plots.</li>
            <li>Durable, low maintenance parts: Built to withstand rural Gambian conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond the technology, Weral Greenfield provides installation, training, and maintenance support, ensuring farmers not only receive a product but also gain the knowledge to maximize its benefits. Future upgrades include mobile app integration for remote monitoring.</p>
        <p>This solution directly tackles water scarcity, high farming costs, and inconsistent yields—empowering farmers to produce more food, earn more income, and conserve the environment.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="market">
        <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
        <p>The Gambia’s agriculture sector represents enormous untapped potential. With urbanization increasing demand for vegetables, tourism driving consumption in hotels and restaurants, and regional trade routes opening in West Africa, there is strong market demand for both fresh produce and sustainable farming technologies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary customers: Smallholder farmers who need affordable irrigation solutions.</li>
            <li>Secondary customers: Supermarkets, hotels, restaurants, and institutions buying fresh produce.</li>
            <li>Regional potential: Neighboring countries face similar climate and water challenges, creating expansion opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By combining produce sales with technology licensing, Weral Greenfield positions itself at the intersection of food security, renewable energy, and sustainable development.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="business">
        <h2>Business Model / Operations</h2>
        <p>Weral Greenfield runs on a dual model:</p>
        <ul>
